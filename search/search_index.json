Overview This Wiki is designed as a central hub for all things about the Splunk - Minecraft Fields Good project to assist in the build, configure and delivery of Workshops and Sessions into local schools and communities; using Minecraft as a medium to teach IT Operations, CyberSecurity and Machine Learning skills to 8 - 18 year olds. The project leverages a Minecraft based plugin to generate JSON based event logs on user behaviour within the Minecraft world. These logs are ingested by Splunk and fed into pre-configured Splunk dashboards to assist in the delivery, explanation and demonstration of the power of data to a younger audience; leveraging Minecraft as the medium to achieve this. Project Sponsors This project is primarily sponsored by 13Fields as part of the 'Fields Good' core value to give back to local communities and develop new ways of engaging the wider ecosystem.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-13fields-splunk-minecraft-integration-wiki","text":"Hello!

We recommend following the already detailed guides on deploying Docker found on Docker Docs as a great introduction to the subject. If you already have a minecraft server running Spigot then you can skip this section and jump straight into the Splunk App Setup or Download the Splunk App from Splunkbase and get right into it! Docker Image Basics The base Docker image is based on the Ashdev Docker Spigot image. This image allows us to, essentially, unpack and build the version of Spigot / Bukkit we want for the Minecraft Addon. The code has been tested as working on Minecraft version 1.12.x - 1.16.3 once compiled against the correct library version. Utiling the below dockerfile yml template we can define a starting framework for the Docker deployment including port mapping for Client Access, persistence of the volumes and IP management. version: \"3\" services: minecraft-java: hostname: minecraft-java image: ashdev/docker-spigot:latest env_file: /var/data/config/minecraft-java/minecraft-java.env volumes: - /var/data/minecraft-java:/minecraft deploy: networks: - public - internal ports: - \"25565:25565\" - \"25565:25565/udp\" - \"1390:1390\" networks: public: external: true internal: driver: overlay ipam: config: - subnet: 10.0.42.0/24 Persisting the volume is required for our logging and our Splunk data collection to work effectively.

The value and importance of locations tracking data can be applied to CyberSecurity through mediums such as door access control, company equiptment, and more. Tracing user behaviour is a common application of Machine Learning for outlier detection. When hackers 'attack' at business they will likely track down a number of individuals or targets they feel can assist or escalate their priviledge to achieve their goal. Defenders also need to leverage User behaviour tracking capabiities for detection of malicious behaviour, outliers and potential insider threat scenarios. This scenario allows a game of hide and seek through the use of Splunk data and a simple dashboard to track where players are in the game world and phish them out. Scenario Outline Leverages the 'status' event.type from the Splunk logs as the basis of the dashboard.

Additional contect is provided on the dashboard to show relative location and direction for the Hunter to the Hunted targets to assist in direction of travel. Scenario Rules Any player who stays in one spot within the game will be hit by lava though the detection of 3 status events showing minimal movement in a 5 x 5 location by lava spawning in the centre square of the location ( this can be triggered through an automated alert from Splunk to Phantom or trigger of console commands within Minecraft manually ). The Dashboard does not show location polls if you are sneaking with the poll is taken. If a player is over 2000 squares away then the Hunter has the opportunity to be teleported automatically to their last detected location Every 5 minutes, an increasing number of Mobs spawn close to the Hunted players to force continued movement At the 10 minute mark; a broadcast is sent out in the Minecraft world advising all Hunted players to attempt to reach a randomised location centralised between all Hunted and Hunter players","title":"Hunting - hide & seek"},{"location":"hunted/#hunted-playing-hide-seek","text":"The Hunted: hide & Seek scenario is useful to demonstrate the value and importance of user data; tracking and being aware of how your movement can easily be tracked through mediums such as GPS, Social Media, and other tools and used against you.

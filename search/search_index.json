Overview This Wiki is designed as a central hub for all things about the Splunk - Minecraft Fields Good project to assist in the build, configure and delivery of Workshops and Sessions into local schools and communities; using Minecraft as a medium to teach IT Operations, CyberSecurity and Machine Learning skills to 8 - 18 year olds. The project leverages a Minecraft based plugin to generate JSON based event logs on user behaviour within the Minecraft world. These logs are ingested by Splunk and fed into pre-configured Splunk dashboards to assist in the delivery, explanation and demonstration of the power of data to a younger audience; leveraging Minecraft as the medium to achieve this. Project Sponsors This project is primarily sponsored by 13Fields as part of the 'Fields Good' core value to give back to local communities and develop new ways of engaging the wider ecosystem.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-13fields-splunk-minecraft-integration-wiki","text":"Hello!

We recommend following the already detailed guides on deploying Docker found on Docker Docs as a great introduction to the subject. If you already have a minecraft server running Spigot then you can skip this section and jump straight into the Splunk App Setup or Download the Splunk App from Splunkbase and get right into it! Docker Image Basics The base Docker image is based on the Ashdev Docker Spigot image. This image allows us to, essentially, unpack and build the version of Spigot / Bukkit we want for the Minecraft Addon. The code has been tested as working on Minecraft version 1.12.x - 1.16.3 once compiled against the correct library version. Utiling the below dockerfile yml template we can define a starting framework for the Docker deployment including port mapping for Client Access, persistence of the volumes and IP management. version: \"3\" services: minecraft-java: hostname: minecraft-java image: ashdev/docker-spigot:latest env_file: /var/data/config/minecraft-java/minecraft-java.env volumes: - /var/data/minecraft-java:/minecraft deploy: networks: - public - internal ports: - \"25565:25565\" - \"25565:25565/udp\" - \"1390:1390\" networks: public: external: true internal: driver: overlay ipam: config: - subnet: 10.0.42.0/24 Persisting the volume is required for our logging and our Splunk data collection to work effectively.

Overview This Wiki is designed as a central hub for all things about the Splunk - Minecraft Fields Good project to assist in the build, configure and delivery of Workshops and Sessions into local schools and communities; using Minecraft as a medium to teach IT Operations, CyberSecurity and Machine Learning skills to 8 - 18 year olds. The project leverages a Minecraft based plugin to generate JSON based event logs on user behaviour within the Minecraft world. These logs are ingested by Splunk and fed into pre-configured Splunk dashboards to assist in the delivery, explanation and demonstration of the power of data to a younger audience; leveraging Minecraft as the medium to achieve this. Project Sponsors This project is primarily sponsored by 13Fields as part of the 'Fields Good' core value to give back to local communities and develop new ways of engaging the wider ecosystem.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-13fields-splunk-minecraft-integration-wiki","text":"Hello!

Initial Baseline Walkthroughs Leverage block types to discuss concepts of Network Security and basic 'penetration' of systems: Wooden Blocks: show poorly configured systems and ease of access Stone Blocks: while stronger, still provide minimal 'true' defence from attackers but will fend off basic Malware / Mobs Obsidian: While a strong firewall will prevent the majority of attacks; persistence will still pay off. Workarounds can be found and exploits discovered to get around these controls Bedrock: The 'silver bullet' of IT and Security. While many claim to provide this; there isn't one way to achieve 'true' defence and players in Minecraft will always find a way around Understanding of Mobs as destructive forces within an IT estate: Zombies can be simple Malware; attacking users who come across it through Phishing, fake downloads, poor browsing behaviour and more Creepers are like IT Operations issues where sudden changes in system performance can have a major impact on the quality and health of the service / player Endermen behave like Command and Control systems; observing and only attacking once co-ordinated and attempted removal Ransomware is a major issue: Lava can be utilised to deploy and damage major operations and bases in Minecraft worlds with just a few buckets! It doesn't take a lot for Ransomware to compromise a company and cause irreversable harm Follow Up Scenarios From these basic principles we can demonstrate general IT concepts to our target audience easily and effectively.
